As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments.

When another brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life.

But modern tellers of Greek myth have usually been men, and have routinely shown little interest in telling women\'s stories. And when they do, those women are often painted as monstrous, vengeful or just plain evil.
